    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Learning and experimenting with code</li>
        <p>I just started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in November of 2020. I dabbled with Python and C++ and I would like to go back and
        develop those skills. For now though, I'm sticking with the former three languages in hopes of finding a related job. Coding was something
        I wasn't sure I would enjoy and thought it would be a lot harder than it really is.</p>
        <li>Playing video games</li>
        <p>I've been playing video games my whole life. I've stuck with <a href="https://secure.runescape.com/m=hiscore/compare?user1=Magicman5956#_ga=2.157264891.1126685793.1607080550-137674649.1582644700">Runescape</a> for a long time now, more than 15 years. I enjoy it, but never really put the time in to max out all my skills. I play on PlaySation as well,
        mostly Call of Duty and the Resident Evil remakes.</p>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <p>I'm a fan of Tim Lebbon and Wilbur Smith, but honestly will read anything.</p>
